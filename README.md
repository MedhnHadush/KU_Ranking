## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Basic Usage
```python
# Import the analysis module
from qs_analysis import predict_optimal_scores_for_top_150_100

# Run comprehensive difficulty-based analysis
predict_optimal_scores_for_top_150_100()
```

## üìà Core Analysis Functions

### 1. **Difficulty-Based Optimal Score Prediction**
```python
predict_optimal_scores_for_top_150_100()
```
**Features:**
- Analyzes improvement difficulty across the entire dataset
- Uses sophisticated difficulty assessment algorithm
- Provides strategic recommendations based on feasibility
- Generates visualizations of current vs target scores

**Difficulty Assessment Factors:**
- Current performance level (30% weight)
- Score variability across universities (20% weight)
- Distance from top performers (25% weight)
- Current score level (25% weight)

### 2. **Top 150 Analysis**
```python
analyze_top_150_qs('path_to_qs_data.csv')
```
- Analyzes top 150 universities
- Compares target university performance
- Identifies gaps and opportunities

### 3. **Peer Benchmarking**
```python
benchmark_peers = [
    ("Universiti Putra Malaysia", "Malaysia"),
    ("Qatar University", "Qatar"),
    ("United Arab Emirates University", "United Arab Emirates"),
    ("King Saud University", "Saudi Arabia")
]
create_peer_comparison_chart('path_to_qs_data.csv', benchmark_peers)
```

### 4. **Historical Trends Analysis**
```python
create_historical_rank_chart()  # 2022-2026 ranking trends
create_malaysia_uae_trends()    # Regional comparison
```

### 5. **Strategic Scenario Analysis**
```python
create_what_if_scenarios('current_data.csv', 'previous_data.csv')
```

## üéØ Strategic Insights

### Difficulty-Based Improvement Strategy
The analysis uses a sophisticated algorithm that considers:

1. **Current Performance Level** (30% weight)
   - Position relative to global distribution
   - Distance from top performers

2. **Score Variability** (20% weight)
   - Coefficient of variation across universities
   - Ease of standing out in the indicator

3. **Distance from Top** (25% weight)
   - Gap to top 10% performers
   - Realistic improvement potential

4. **Current Score Level** (25% weight)
   - Absolute performance level
   - Room for improvement

### Priority Categories
- **üöÄ QUICK WINS**: Easy improvements (Difficulty ‚â§ 30)
- **üéØ HIGH IMPACT**: Important indicators with moderate difficulty
- **‚ö° MODERATE EFFORT**: Balanced difficulty and impact
- **üèóÔ∏è LONG-TERM**: Challenging areas requiring sustained effort

## üìä QS 2026 Methodology Support

The code supports the official 2026 QS World University Rankings methodology:

- **Academic Reputation (30%)**: Global academic survey
- **Citations per Faculty (20%)**: Research impact measurement
- **Employer Reputation (15%)**: Graduate employability survey
- **Faculty Student Ratio (10%)**: Teaching quality indicator
- **Employment Outcomes (5%)**: Graduate employment rates
- **International Faculty (5%)**: International diversity
- **International Research Network (5%)**: Research collaboration
- **International Student Diversity (0%)**: Student diversity (not weighted in 2026)
- **International Students (5%)**: International student ratio
- **Sustainability (5%)**: Environmental and social impact

## üîß Technical Details

### Data Processing
- Automatic cleaning of rank columns (removing '=' symbols)
- Handling of rank ranges (using midpoints)
- Missing data imputation and validation
- Cross-year data consistency checks

### Statistical Methods
- Linear regression for trend analysis
- Correlation analysis for indicator relationships
- Quantile-based difficulty assessment
- Weighted improvement allocation

### Visualization Features
- Interactive spider charts
- Multi-year trend analysis
- Peer comparison visualizations
- Employment correlation charts

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
# Run comprehensive analysis
predict_optimal_scores_for_top_150_100()

# Generate specific visualizations
create_spider_chart('path_to_qs_data.csv')
create_historical_rank_chart()
```

### Custom Peer Analysis
```python
# Define custom peer universities
custom_peers = [
    ("Your University", "Country"),
    ("Another University", "Country")
]

# Run peer benchmarking
create_peer_comparison_chart('path_to_qs_data.csv', custom_peers)
```
